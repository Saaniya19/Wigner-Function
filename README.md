# Wigner-Function
The first interactive, 3D model of a quantum probability function, called the Wigner Function, graphed on a toroidal lattice. 

This program was coded by Saaniya Saraf and the project was lead by UWaterloo Professor Robert Mann and graduate student Jack Davis.

This is a function/map of the probability of existance of a particle at a certain position and with a certain spin.

The red areas represent higher probability values and the blue areas represent lower probability values.
